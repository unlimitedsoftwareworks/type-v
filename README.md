Type-V
===

Type-V is a virtual machine for running type-c programs.

### About
Type-V is a VM and runtime environment for type-c programs.
While the VM can be used for generic purposes, its instructions are heavily optimized
for type-c source code, such as offset-based data types (structs, array etc), 
built-in concurrency, etc.

As for the right now, the VM is still experimental and lacking major features.

Progress:

- [x] Assembler
- [x] Instruction set specification
- [x] Processes (not to be confused with OS processes)
- [ ] Garbage collection
- [ ] Unit tests
